# SoftBank-Forex-Algorithm-Challenge
Foreign exchange risk management and trading algorithms

##
Bitgrit has partnered with SoftBank to host a competition for forecasting future exchange rates to hedge currency risks with regards to the USD and the JPY on the basis of historic exchange data and economic news data. The algorithm adopted may be used in the foreign exchange market with a market size of over $500B/day in the future.


### 

        ● Created an algorithm to forecast future
    exchange rates on the basis of historic exchange
    data released by Softbank.
        ● Dataset consists of 360 features along with
    several NaN values. 
        ● Best accuracy was obtained by filling NaN
    values with the nearest row value (by distance)
    in its column.
        ● Trained on Catboost and achieved an accuracy
    of 97% upon tuning parameters and
    ensembling the best submissions.
